He was a seasoned combat and engineer officer who spent most of his assignment in the field which exposed him to diversified leadership challenges and complex engineering works while engaging in community-based development projects. He started his military career as a Platoon Leader, Company Ex-o, Company Commander, Field Staff Officer and Battalion Commander to units assigned in the hinterlands of Bicol Region, Northern Samar, Bondoc Peninsula, Northern Luzon, Panay, Bohol, Negros Island, Basilan and Sulo.

He is a proud father of two daughters and one son from his loving wife, the former Misss Catherine Sabalza of Palapag, Northern Samar. At present, he keeps himself engaged in community outreach in his home town of Manito, Albay to help his town mates uplift their living condition.\r&lt;br/&gt;With these sterling accomplishments, he proved his mettle not only as a combatant commander but more so as a builder to win the peace and bring progress in the countryside. On a more personal note, BGEN ALEXIS D. TAMONDONG remained a very humble person we have known in high school, so kind and helpful to all the people in need.

It was his grandfather, Mr. Mariano Abaroa who motivated and encouraged him to take Law. His grandfather passed away while he was a freshman in the College of Law.

Despite his predicament, he never gave up trying to help support his family. He worked part-time in the supply section of the Department of Health Regional Office. Determined and more serious about achieving his goals, he attained high grades.\r&lt;br/&gt;\r&lt;br/&gt;For the next two years, he juggled his time carrying heavy boxes of medical supplies to the adjacent provincial hospital at daytime and studying the intricacies of the provisions of the laws at night.
